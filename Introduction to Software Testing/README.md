Software Testing Course – Learning Repository

This repository contains the exercises and materials developed during a Software Testing course focused on the foundations of software quality and automated testing.

Throughout the course, I learned the fundamental principles and processes of software testing, created and executed test cases, and used automated tools to validate software behavior. I practiced writing effective test cases including input data and expected outcomes, and developed the ability to evaluate the quality and adequacy of tests.
